# PrivacyExtended

Link to add to uBlock Origin:

This filter list is meant to use with uBlock Origin (uBO)'s default lists (especially EasyPrivacy). Using it alone might not be as effective.

### Warning
1. *This is still a personal work-in-progress project. At this time it does not have much advantage over Adguard's Tracking Protection List and the current goal includes:*

- *Remove redundant with EasyPrivacy,*
- *Reduce extra whitelisting due to different approaches to the same issue between uBO and Adguard,*
- *Resolving issue faster if reproducible is not stable between uBO and Adguard.*

2. Click-tracking section is for stopping tracking instertitial page. The filters are intentionally crafted so users can decide to click on destination link or not. They are not breakages so please do not open "breakages" issues about these filters.
