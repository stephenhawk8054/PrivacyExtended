# PrivacyExtended

Link to add to uBlock Origin:

This filter list is meant to use with uBlock Origin (uBO)'s default lists (especially EasyPrivacy). Using it alone might not be as effective.

### Warning
*This is still a personal work-in-progress project. At this time it does not have much advantage over Adguard's Tracking Protection List and the current goal includes:*

- *Remove redundant with EasyPrivacy,*
- *Reduce extra whitelisting due to different approaches to the same issue between uBO and Adguard,*
- *Resolving issue faster if reproducible is not stable between uBO and Adguard.*
